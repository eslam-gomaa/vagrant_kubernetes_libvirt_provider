# vagrant_kubernetes_libvirt_provider

This is a Vagrant file for creating a Kubernetes LAB with ability to add worker nodes on the fly

---

**CAUTION** -- If you're NOT using this Vagrant file as part of my course LABs, please comment or delete the following lines
```ruby
if File.stat("share").uid == 0
  FileUtils.chown_R 'orange', 'orange', 'share', verbose: true
end
```

## Instructions

💎 For creating the vm's for the first time; it's recommended to use `--no-parallel` option to make sure that the master vm is created before the worker nodes

```
vagrant up --no-parallel
```

💎 List the existing VMs

```
vagrant status
```

💎 Destroy a single VM

```
vagrant destroy -f worker-2
```


💎 Destroy all the VMs

```
vagrant destroy -f
```


💎 Shutdown all the VMs

```

🌼 To increase the number of worker nodes

Change `worker_nodes_number` number to the desired number of Worker nodes, then execute `vagrant up` to apply changes
